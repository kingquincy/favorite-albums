    <p class="details"><b>Background :</b> Graduation is the third installment of West's planned tetralogy of
        education-themed studio albums, which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the
        conception of his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008). The album demonstrates yet another distinctive
        progression in West's musical style and approach to production. After spending the previous year touring the
        world with Irish rock band U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West became inspired by watching Bono open the stadium
        tours every night to incredible ovations and sought out to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more
        efficiently in large stadiums and arenas. In West's attempt to accomplish this "stadium-status" endeavor, West
        incorporated layered electronic synthesizers into his hip-hop production, which also finds him utilizing slower
        tempos, being influenced by the music of the 1980s, and experimenting with electronic music. West was
        particularly influenced by house music, a subgenre of electronic dance music that first originated in his
        hometown of Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s.</p><br>
