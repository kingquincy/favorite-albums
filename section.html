            <p class="details"><b>Background :</b> Section.80 received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 113 on the US Billboard 200. As of February 2014, Section.80 sold 130,000 copies domestically. In April 2017, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Section.80 is Kendrick Lamar's first studio release, followed by the release of five of his mixtapes and his first extended-play (EP). Lamar began working on the album from around January 2011. He recorded the album at Top Dawg Studios in Carson, California, and wrote most of it in his mother's kitchen and tour bus. While recording the album he wished for it to be "as organic as possible.", at times leaving songs unfinished for extended periods of time. Lamar felt compelled to create the album after seeing a friend of his go to jail for twenty-five years and experiencing the pain of such an event.</p><br>
